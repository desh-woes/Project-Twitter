# Introduction
Welcome to this repository. While it is still in a growing phase, the main idea/use of this repository is to document my data analytics projects that are related to Twitter data or make use of the Tweepy API from Twitter. Most of the code base for this repository would be in Python so hopefully it will be easy to understand and go through as many projects that I eventually implement in this repository.

## Structure:
The structure for this repository will be based on the table of contents which will contain all the different projects implemented in this repository. Beneath the table of contents will contain short descriptions of each project implemented.
